## Retail Sales & Inventory Dashboard
 ### 📖 Overview
This project analyzes **9,800+ retail transactions** (Kaggle dataset) to simulate the type of **catalog, availability, and KPI tracking dashboards** used in grocery/retail programs like Amazon Fresh Partnerships.  

The goal was to demonstrate **Excel + SQL + dashboarding skills** in surfacing insights, tracking KPIs, and presenting business metrics in a clear, actionable way.  


### 🎯 Business Problem
Retail and grocery operations rely on monitoring:
- 📦 **Top product categories** driving revenue
- 🌍 **Regional sales distribution**
- 📈 **Monthly demand trends**
- ⚠️ **Stock availability & risk indicators**

This project simulates how a Program Manager would structure a **partner onboarding or catalog optimization dashboard** for leadership visibility.



### 🛠 Tools & Skills
- Excel (Advanced):** Pivot tables, charts, slicers, conditional formatting
- SQL:** Queries to aggregate and clean retail sales data
- Python/Pandas:** For preprocessing raw data
- Data Visualization:** Excel dashboard with KPI chart
  
### 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Retail/Grocery Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting)

### 📈 Key Insights
1. **Phones & Chairs** are top revenue drivers (> $300K each).  
2. **West region** leads sales with 36% share, followed by East at 34%.  
3. **Sales trend** shows seasonal spikes, aligning with promotions/holidays.

## 🛠️ SQL Analysis Queries  

I used SQL to analyze the raw retail sales dataset before building the dashboards.  
This ensured the data was **clean, aggregated, and ready for visualization**.  

### 🔎 Example Queries  

**1. Total Sales by Region**  
```sql
SELECT Region, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM raw_sales
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;

**2. Top 10 Sub-Categories by Sales
SELECT Category, Sub_Category, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM raw_sales
GROUP BY Category, Sub_Category
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC
LIMIT 10;

**3.  Monthly Sales Trend
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', Order_Date) AS Month, SUM(Sales) AS Monthly_Sales
FROM raw_sales
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', Order_Date)
ORDER BY Month;

**4. Sales by Customer Segment
ELECT Segment, SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales
FROM raw_sales
GROUP BY Segment
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC;
